# Hugo SSG Training Repo
This is a sample repo containing files generated by the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. This repo was created for records and training purposes only and is not meant to be updated in the near future except for building custom Hugo themes in the future.

A few of my existing (and probably future) side projects will be made using Hugo, but the official files will be in separate repos. I plan on rebuilding the following (or converting) to Hugo below:

- [ADRIANNE.dev](https://adrianne.dev)
- [ADRIANNE.io](https://adrianne.io)
- [Adrianne Codes](https://adrianne.codes)
- Separate portfolio for my data visualization/data science projects
- Upcoming blog site specifically for my Miraculous Ladybug & Cat Noir Fanfic(s)

Please feel free to check this repo out for reference if you are also learning how to create static sites using Hugo. Thank you!
